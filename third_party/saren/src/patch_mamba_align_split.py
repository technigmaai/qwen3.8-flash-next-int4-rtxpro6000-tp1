"""Fix: two sites treat EngineCore's rewritten block_size as the mamba size.

The scheduler's ``cache_config.block_size`` is rewritten by EngineCore to the
*minimum* block size across KV cache groups (the fine/draft granularity — 8 on
this model), while the mamba/GDN state groups use 1600-token blocks
(``cache_config.mamba_block_size``, set by _align_hybrid_block_size and left
intact). ``_mamba_block_aligned_split`` exists purely to make prefill chunks
end where a mamba state can be cached, i.e. at MAMBA block boundaries — but it
reads ``cache_config.block_size``.

Observed effect (VLLM_HIT_DEBUG traces, 8036-token prompt): the only chunk
stop lands at 8024 (8-aligned, not 1600-aligned), the state slots all stay
null, the cold request publishes ZERO mamba hashes, and since the hybrid
cache-hit is the min across all groups the 2nd identical request misses
completely (hit=0). Only the shared-prefix-junction machinery, triggered by
that miss, forces a 1600-aligned stop — so the 3rd request is the first to
hit. Long production prompts published no mamba states at all (~1% hit rate),
which also starved the never-evict pin of mamba blocks to hold.

Build-time script: edits vLLM sources in place inside the image. The anchor
is asserted unique so upstream drift fails the build instead of silently
mis-patching.
